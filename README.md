# Smart Investment Fund Token - Windows Client
The Windows GUI for SIFT provides an easy way to keep on top of your SIFT portfolio.  You can, of course, manage your SIFT transactions directly through the ethereum blockchain but this Windows GUI provides an easier way.

During the ICO this client provides a simple one-click way to exchange your ether balance for SIFT.  You just need to make sure that Geth or your Mist wallet is running with IPC enabled and then run our application.

You can view full step-by-step instructions on how to install SIFT at http://SmartIFT.com/sift-win

# Build Status
Builds are automatically generated whenever a new commit is merged in to the appropriate branch.   The develop branch is used for test builds that we are not yet ready to release to the general public, but which may be perfectly functional, the master branch is the recommended branch for most users who don't want bleeding-edge fucntionality.  Successful builds result in a new release automatically being generated and the code tagged to match that version.  Any builds from a branch other than master should be considered pre-release.
