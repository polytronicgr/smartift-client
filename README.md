# Smart Investment Fund Token - Windows Client
The Windows GUI for SIFT provides an easy way to keep on top of your SIFT portfolio.  You can, of course, manage your SIFT transactions directly through the ethereum blockchain but this Windows GUI provides an easier way.

During the ICO this client provides a simple one-click way to exchange your ether balance for SIFT.  You just need to make sure that Geth or your Mist wallet is running with IPC enabled and then run our application.
